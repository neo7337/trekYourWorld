## trekYourWorld

trekYourWorld is an open source project made for the trekking/hiking community.

### Out Story
I have been trekking for more than 3 years and have gone with different organisers. It is always a challenge to find out before hand which organiser would suit us better. There are multiple routes for a given trek on some occasions and making a decision makes it challenging. Me and my friends have also faced challenges on chosing which trek to do, given our fitness levels and other factors which trek should we undertake. To address all these queries and much more, we have come up with the open source project __trekYourWorld__ for the community.

## Solution
Build a one stop solution for the hiking/trekking community for all of us to make a better and comparative choices. Our platform will provide the maximum information that we can provide for the trekkers so that they can chose what's best for them.
